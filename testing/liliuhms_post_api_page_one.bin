(happy halloweeeeen!)</p><p>So actually, I was thinking about it and I feel bad if you get charged tomorrow, November 1st, while my shop is open!!</p><p>I know many of you are planning to purchase something from me, which I so appreciate! Therefore I have decided to pause the November payment. Especially with holiday shopping coming up, I would rather you use your expenses towards that this month!</p><p>This being said, that means all of my digital content for November will come to you FREE OF CHARGE! It's my gift to you! Thank you for your support these last few months, and especially your patience! I will let you know when I will be resuming payments again!</p><p>Cheers!</p>",
